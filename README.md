# PHARMACY-MEDICATION-MANAGEMENT
Simple Pharmacy Management System. I have used JAVA as the programming language and for database I have used MySQL via WAMP server. I have included the DB file so that you can simply import the database with the sample data. This project manages information about medicines from a pharmacy, by saving their list in a database.

The main interface(PHARMACY) will allow the following operations:
- Adding a medicine;
- Updating the information of a medicine;
- Deleting the information of a medicine;
- Display medicines from the database ordered by name or price;
- Searching for a medicine in the database and displaying information about it;

This project has been implemented for my third year subject(Java Programming) . 
You may need to install Netbeans, MySQL database server and Java JDK to run it.
